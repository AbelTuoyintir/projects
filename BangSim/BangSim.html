He introduced himself and welcome them warmly to NoniHub, as part of his introductory speech he also orientated the students of how to navigate themselves around the building, which included showing them each office and its function in an orderly manner without forgetting the washrooms. His speech was brief and simple; it took about 6 minutes.
          The second speaker was by Miss Winifred Zoyaar who was the second facilitator. She gave out the password WIFI to students to connect to the internet for them to be able to log in their students portals. It was then followed by personal introduction of herself and students in a systematic order. From observation, all students cooperated fully to this exercise. She continues by introducing the course to the students and goals at the end of the training session and some of the job opportunity that are available in the world. According to her, during her speech, she is state that she was supposed to teach the how to navigate or use their students portal but this was impeded by a technical problem where most not to say none of the students were not able to log in to their students portal.

She started with an introductory video to create the concept or awareness of the students. The video was a summary of the subject matter which was very information.

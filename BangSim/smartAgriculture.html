               Soil Monitoring
            </h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Soil Monitoring with IoT uses technology to empower farmers and producers to maximise yield, reduce disease and optimise resources. IoT sensors can measure soil temperature, NPK, volumetric water content, photosynthetic radiation, soil water potential and soil oxygen levels. Data from the IoT sensors are then transmitted back to a central point (or the cloud) for analysis, visualisation and trend analysis.</p>
            
            </div>
           <div class="text">
            <p>The resultant data can then be used to optimise farming operations, identify trends and make subtle adjustments to conditions to maximise crop yield and quality. The use of IoT in agriculture is known as Smart Agriculture (or Smart Farming), and IoT is a central component of Precision Farming.</p>

            <h2>What can I measure with Smart Agriculture / IoT sensors?</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Smart Agriculture is focused on soil, weather and crop conditions. Given the importance of weather and irrigation, many Smart Farming solutions are coupled with Smart Environment (Air Quality) and Smart Water (Pollution, Turbidity, Nutrients) for a complete solution. The most common IoT sensors are listed below:

            <h2 >Soil Temperature</h2>

                <p>Smart Agriculture Node - monitoring moisture, conductivity, surface temperature and soil temperature.
                    Smart Agriculture Node â€“ monitoring moisture, conductivity, surface temperature and soil temperature.
                    Soil temperature is an essential factor in belowground plant activity, influencing root growth, respiration, decomposition and mineralisation of nitrogen. IoT sensors can estimate soil temperature by measuring air temperature and other factors; however, the most accurate measurement is to use a probe buried in the soil.
                    Depending on the root structure of the plant in question, multiple probes can be installed at different depths. Surface soil temperature can be monitored using a different type of IoT sensor that uses IR technology.</p>

            <h2>Soil Moisture</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>The moisture content of soil can also be monitored using buried probes with electrodes. In hydrology, soil science and agricultural moisture content play a vital role in soil chemistry, plant growth and groundwater recharge. Soil moisture content is essential for several reasons:</p>

           <p> Water in the soil serves as a critical nutrient for all crops and plants.
            Water is an essential component of photosynthesis.
            Crop yield is heavily influenced by the availability of water in the soil.
            Soil water is an important carrier of soluble food nutrients for plant growth.
            Soil water helps regulate soil temperatures.
            Soil science is a complex area, and suffice to say; it is beyond the scope of this article! IoT and Smart Agriculture technology from Libelium can  measure the following:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Soil moisture (3 x depths)</li>
                <li>Conductivity.</li>
                <li>Volumetric water content.</li>
                <li>Soil water potential.</li>
            </ul>
